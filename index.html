  You Are The Sunshine Of My Life <br>

    Lyrics:
  </h2>
  
</body> You are the <strong> sunshine </strong>of my <em>my </em> life <br>
That's why I'll always be around <br>
You are the apple of <em>my</em> eye <br>
Forever you'll stay in my heart <br>
I feel like this is the beginning <br>
Though I've loved you for a million years <br>
And if I thought our love was ending <br>
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears, whoa, oh, oh <br>
  You are the sunshine of <em>my</em>life, yeah <br>
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah <br>
You are the apple of <em>my</em> eye <br>
Forever you'll stay in my heart <br>
You must have known that I was lonely <br>
Because you came to my rescue <br>
And I know that this must be <strong> heaven</strong><br>
How could so much love be inside of you? <br>
Whoa, whoa <br>
You are the sunshine of <em> my </em>life, yeah <br>
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm (baby) <br>
You are the apple of <em>my </em>eye <br>
Forever you'll stay in my heart, yeah <br>
You are the sunshine of <em>my</em> life, baby <br>
That's why <strong>I'll always stay around</strong><br>
